            world. <br><br>

<h2 id="believe">What do we believe?</h2>
<div id="aboutinfo">
We believe in God, the Father almighty,
      creator of heaven and earth. <br><br>
We believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
      who was conceived by the Holy Spirit
      and born of the virgin Mary.<br><br>
      He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
      was crucified, died, and was buried;
      he descended to hell. <br><br>
      The third day he rose again from the dead. <br><br>
      He ascended to heaven
      and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty. <br><br>
      From there he will come to judge the living and the dead. <br><br>
We believe in the Holy Spirit, <br><br>
      the holy catholic church, <br><br>
      the communion of saints, <br><br>
      the forgiveness of sins, <br><br>
      the resurrection of the body, <br><br>
      and the life everlasting. Amen.

<h2 id="believe">Intervarsity Doctrinal Basis</h2>
<div id="aboutinfo">

We believe in: <br><br>

The only true God, the almighty Creator of all things,<br><br>
  existing eternally in three persons<br><br>
  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit full of love and glory. <br><br>

The unique divine inspiration,<br><br>
  entire trustworthiness<br><br>
  and authority of the Bible.<br><br>

The value and dignity of all people:<br><br>
  created in God's image to live in love and holiness,<br><br>
  but alienated from God and each other because of our     sin and guilt, <br><br> and justly subject to God's wrath. <br><br>

Jesus Christ, fully human and fully divine, <br><br>
  who lived as a perfect example,<br><br> who assumed the             judgment due sinners by dying in our place, <br><br>and who         was bodily raised from the dead and ascended as Savior     and Lord. <br><br>

Justification by God's grace to all who repent <br><br>
  and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. <br><br>

The indwelling presence and transforming power of the    Holy Spirit, <br><br>who gives to all believers a new life and a new  calling to obedient service.<br><br>

The unity of all believers in Jesus Christ, <br><br>
  manifest in worshiping and witnessing churches <br><br>
  making disciples throughout the world. <br><br>

The victorious reign and future personal return of Jesus       Christ, <br><br> who will judge all people with justice and mercy, <br><br>
   giving over the unrepentant to eternal condemnation <br><br>
   but receiving the redeemed into eternal life. <br><br>

To God be glory forever.<br><br>
